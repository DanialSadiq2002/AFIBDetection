# AFIBDetection
AFIBnet is a pioneering solution designed to detect atrial fibrillation (AFib) using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. By converting PPG signals into electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory rate, AFIBnet integrates multi-parameter data to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability in continuous AFib monitoring.

Features

    Real-time PPG to ECG and respiratory rate conversion
    Advanced feature extraction from PPG, ECG, and respiratory signals
    High diagnostic accuracy for AFib detection
    Comprehensive dataset integration and feature fusion
    Robust machine learning model with 92% accuracy using Random Forest

Installation

To get started with AFIBnet, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
