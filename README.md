# AFIBDetection
AFIBnet is a pioneering solution designed to detect atrial fibrillation (AFib) using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. By converting PPG signals into electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory rate, AFIBnet integrates multi-parameter data to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability in continuous AFib monitoring.
